# Examples
This Visual-Studio project contains examples about the programming with the [iplus-framework](https://iplus-framework.com/).
Read the [online manual](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/6a220db6-a767-40bb-bf95-395e4a289881?workspaceSchemaID=bce1702a-7637-4b98-83db-01a9d7a3a156) to understand the code in this example.

# What is the iplus-framework?
The iplus-framework is a software platform that combines database-based with object-oriented application development and its presentation layer. It functions **as both development and runtime environment**. Basically it is an extension of the .NET framework from Microsoft so that service-oriented client / server applications can be developed more easily, flexibly and quickly.

You can use it to develop

- transaction-based systems (ERP, CRM, MES...),
- SCADA applications,
- mobile solutions,
- time critical and scalable backend solutions (Multitier)
- machine controls with frontend
...
with a **uniform programming model**. By "uniform" is meant that it makes no difference whether you develop a class for server-side or client-side use. A transaction-based form is programmed in the same way as a communication component or an automation object such as a motor or temperature sensor.

You can also deploy **your solutions as software components**, which in turn other developers and project or project engineers use to deliver an integrated overall solution to their end customers. A project engineer does not have to have any programming skills, because he only has to orchestrate the components via drag & drop in the iplus development environment.

This new approach enables a huge increase in productivity and an unprecedented ease of use and simplicity for developers, project engineers, consultants and end users.

# Architecture
An **object-oriented, component based framework** forms the core of iplus which is based on the microsoftsÂ® .NET framework. The system is structured in an altogether **service-oriented** way, which is to say that all classes and components are brought to life through database configuration only.
All instances are capable of collective, **network-transparent communication**. The programming of components is likewise carried out network-transparently. That results in an unlimited scalability of the system and enables the building of multitier architectures with one click.
In addition, the system operates fully **event-driven** to ensure the event processing and visualization in **near real-time**.
